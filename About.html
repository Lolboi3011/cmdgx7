    <p>Hello, my names Lucas S. You may know me from creating saul.com prevouisly saul.com got blocked and my access to google sites was gone too, and I was hopeless and deprate to find another site builder. Untill I realised, I could code a site. I would pick a video explaining EVERYTHING about how to use html, how to make sites with html and css, and more. So here i am, Back and know making another site! I will update and add new games everyweek and when i have time to. Enjoy all gxmes! And thank you for reading this.</p>
